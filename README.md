# automatic_fake_image_detection_project

# Before running program, you will need to download the database used in this project. #

There are 3 main databases:
 - CASIA v2
 - CASIA v2 Cropped
 - Defacto-copymove


These databases can be downloaded from:
https://github.com/ChamodKalupahana/automatic_fake_image_detection_project

Download these files and change the CASIA v2 folder path and defacto_folder path in input.py

These datasets are very large so it downloading may take a long time

# IMPORTANT # 
In this github, only a sample of 300 images of CASIA v2 and CASIA v2 Cropped images are included and the copymove images are not included. This is because these are very large databases are too big to upload onto github. To get the full databases, use the links below:

CASIA v2: https://www.kaggle.com/code/shaft49/real-vs-fake-images-casia-dataset
Defacto-copymove: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/defactodataset/defactocopymove
CASIA v2 Cropped: This is a modified database from CASIA v2 that I made myself. Use the database_resampling.py to reproduce this database
